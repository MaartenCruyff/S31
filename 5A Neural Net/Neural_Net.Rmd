## Neural Networks

Prediction model (regression or classification)

- made up of hidden layers with neurons

- behavior of neurons is characterized by an activation function

- "firing rate" of the neurons determined by regression weights


<br>

Training 

1. random configuration of regression weights

2. feedback on model performance to adjust the weights (back-propagation)

3. repeat 2 (epoch) until convergence

4. estimation involves train/dev/test and regularization (L1, L2)
 

## Schematically

A neural network with two hidden layers

## Example house prices 

A neural network with hidden layer to predict price (hence regression)

## Examples of activation functions

- Relu: either 0 or linear

- Sigmoid: between 0 and 1 (probabilities)

## Recent achievements

Alpha-Zero

- learned itself to play chess (no access to chess theory)

- after only 4 hours of practice, it defeated Stockfish (traditional chess machine)
